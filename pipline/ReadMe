# Bronze Ingestion Pipeline

This pipeline ingests raw CSV files from GitHub into the Lakehouse Bronze tables.

## Steps:
1. Lookup JSON config for source files
2. ForEach activity to iterate over entities
3. Copy Data activity to move files to Lakehouse
4. Logging / ingestion timestamp

**Notes:**
- Uses domain-independent ingestion
- Supports incremental loads
